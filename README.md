        - setup detail page
        - Sign in
        - register

    - Better naming of setup.
        - To avoid duplicate file_name, should rename the setup with its id from mongodb DONE
        - then rename it to its original file_name before downloading.

            - Driving style? (Could add this in the listing and the filters. Ex: left foot braker, trail braker, etc...)

        - Give option to suggest new sims, cars and tracks to admin. It should send an email to all admins.
