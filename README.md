IDEAS:

    - On home page, put stats like
        - 'Poster of the history of time'
        - 'Poster of the week'
        - 'Poster with most downloads of the history of time'

        Once the site is cool.

        - 'total members'
        - 'New members this week'

        News section.

        - New tracks / cars available to post/download
        - new site functionality


    - Bookmark / follow user

        - Could have a section on home page where new sets by followed users get displayed. Or notifications system ala facebook.
        - stats for users, how many followers you've got.

    - Hardware setup for user profile
